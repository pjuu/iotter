Pjuu is under very active development at this early stage in its life. A lot
may change between versions until we are happy with it :)
```

A small iOS WebView application for [Pjuu](https://github.com/pjuu/pjuu).

This is an open source project released under the MIT license. See LICENSE for more details or visit http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

### About

This is a very simple iOS application which embeds a WebView. It simply shows the [Pjuu](https://pjuu.com) website.

In the future this will be expanded to show notifications that you have new alerts on the site.

This was build with XCode. This is the same repository that the Android app itself is built from.

### Contributing

We are open to all pull requests. Please not that we are not Android developers, this is as simple an app as it could possibly be. If you would like to help us make tweaks please do, it would be really appreciated.

### Security

All software has bugs in, Pjuu is no different. These may have security implications. If you find one that you suspect could allow you to do something you shouldn't be able to please do not post it as an issue on Github. We would really appreciate it if you could send an e-mail to security@pjuu.com with the relevant details.
